# 001 Text based RPG

The first tutorial is a Text based RPG (Role Playing Game)

This tutorial aims to cover how to use some of the core features of a programming language, such as:

Printing to the console
Taking inputs from the console
importing libraries (Random)
Selection (if elif else statements)
Functions
loops
arrays

Each week I'll upload the code created for each section, which you are free to use and expand upon, if you want to jump right into the middle of the tutorial.

Planned schedule

Week 1 - Creating a character
Week 2 - Creating a world
Week 3 - Adding objectives and items
Week 4 - Adding other characters

This is a rough idea of the schedule.  If I feel the need to add in extra components, or to spend more time on a certain section, then that is of course what I will do.
