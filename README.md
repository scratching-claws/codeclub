A series of programming tutorials aimed at those just starting with learning to code

Regardless of whether you are an educator or student, you can use these tutorials to learn or teach programming.

These code in these tutorials will mainly be in Python, but you could use any language.  I'm using Python because that is the language taught to the students at the school where I am running these tutorials.

Because the nature of these tutorials is that I will be running through them live with the students, each new part will be uploaded as and when written live.

There will be an introductory presentation for each new project, and a slide for each new weekly addition, as well as the demonstration code for each step, but not a step by step guide.  I'd rather add lots of descriptive comments to the code as I write it spontaneously, than plan everything out beforehand.

If you do have questions or problems with the code, create an issue or pull request.

When writing this code, I use liveshare to create a link to share the view only code with the students, as well as projecting my screen to a larger display which everyone in the room can see.

As is probably similar with other schools, the school computers avialable to the students following along with the tutorials are very limited devices, effectively only giving access to the browser.  As such, the students use the Raspberry Pi in browser python IDE, and can access the liveshare through vscode.dev
